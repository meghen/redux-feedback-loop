# Redux Feedback Loop Master

## Description

_Duration: 1 Weekend Sprint_

This app is created to allow students to leave feedback for their professors about how they felt their day went. It asks one question at a time and checks how teh student is feeling, if they understand the material covered in class, if they are feeling supported, and leaves space for them to share comments. Afterwards, it lets them review what they had answered before submitting, which saves their response to a database.
